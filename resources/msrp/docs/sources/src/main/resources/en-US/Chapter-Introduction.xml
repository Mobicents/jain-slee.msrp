	<title>Introduction to &THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE &THIS.RA; Resource Adaptor</title>

	<para>The &THIS.RA; resource adaptor enables an application that is hosted in a SLEE container and that is developed using a Service Building Block to send or receive data using the
    <indexterm><primary>MSRP</primary></indexterm>
    MSRP protocol (RFC 4975). In order to establish sessions, the use of the SIP protocol is required.
 
Therefore, the &THIS.RA; RA cannot be used without the SIP resource adaptor.</para>
    <para>The adaptor effectively wraps the Java MSRP peer library so that it can be used in a SLEE environment.</para>
    <para>Currently,
    <indexterm><primary>nickname</primary></indexterm>
    nicknames are supported (draft-ietf-simple-chat), as well as message composition indication (RFC 3994).</para>
    <para>Secure sessions (msrps) are currently not supported, nor are Relay Extensions (RFC 4976)</para>
    <para>Activities represent MSRP sessions that applications can use to send messages, nicknames, responses and receive events related to incoming MSRP traffic.</para>
    <para>Events represent incoming MSRP messages, reports and session status changes</para>
